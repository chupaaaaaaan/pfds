<p>Every <code>cons</code> and <code>snoc</code> without balancing (reverse) takes 1 step and increase or decrease <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> by 1. And <code>tail</code> and <code>init</code> without balancing also takes 1 step and increase or decrease <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> by 1.</p>
<p><code>cons</code> and <code>snoc</code> with balancing is called only at the first time. it takes 2 steps and increases <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> by 1. The amortized cost <span class="math inline">\(a_i =2+1=3\)</span>. (In my implementation, it is called at the second time, takes 3 steps and decreses <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> by 1, but anyway the number of operations is constant and the conclusion is same.)</p>
<p>Consider <code>tail</code> with balancing, let the size of rear list as <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. It takes <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> steps to reconstruct the two lists and decreases <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{i-1}=m-1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_i=0\)</span>, so the amortized cost <span class="math inline">\(a_i=m+1-(m-1)=2\)</span>. It is also true for <code>init</code> with balancing, so each operation takes <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> amortized time.</p>
